[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
The goals of this project are the following:

- Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior
- Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
- Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
- Summarize the results with a written report
